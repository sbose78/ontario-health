# **Strategic Assessment of Respiratory Pathogen Dynamics and Clinical Capacity in Halton Region: A Technical Blueprint for Snowflake-Enabled Public Health Informatics**

The contemporary landscape of public health surveillance in Southern Ontario has undergone a structural transformation, moving away from fragmented, retrospective reporting toward integrated, high-frequency data ecosystems. For municipalities such as Burlington, situated within the Halton Region, the convergence of seasonal respiratory viral activity and acute care capacity constraints necessitates a sophisticated analytical approach. The 2025–2026 respiratory season has presented a unique epidemiological profile, characterized by a dominant influenza surge, a stable but persistent COVID-19 presence, and significant systemic pressure on local clinical infrastructure. To manage these complexities, healthcare organizations are increasingly adopting cloud-native data architectures. This report provides an exhaustive analysis of recent infection levels and hospital occupancy in the Burlington-Halton corridor, followed by a comprehensive technical framework for architecting an automated data ingestion pipeline into the Snowflake AI Data Cloud using Google-centric APIs and official provincial hospital dashboards.

## **Epidemiological Profile of Respiratory Pathogen Circulation in Halton and Surrounding Regions**

Surveillance of respiratory viruses in Burlington is primarily governed by the Halton Region Public Health unit, which monitors activity across a defined surveillance year running from late August to the following August.1 The current 2025–2026 season, which commenced on August 24, 2025, utilizes a tiered activity level framework ranging from "No Activity" to "Very High" based on percent positivity thresholds.1 As of surveillance week 50, ending December 13, 2025, the regional data indicates a significant escalation in viral transmission, particularly concerning Influenza A and its impact on pediatric and adolescent cohorts.

### **Clinical Surveillance and Pathogen-Specific Positivity Trends**

The most recent laboratory-confirmed data highlights a sharp divergence in the behavior of primary respiratory pathogens. In Halton and the broader Ontario context, influenza has emerged as the primary driver of clinical burden. Provincial percent positivity for influenza reached 33.8% in mid-December, a level categorized as "Very High" and representing a rapid increase from preceding weeks. This surge is predominantly driven by Influenza A (H3N2), specifically the subclade K, which accounts for over 80% of sequenced specimens.2 The demographic distribution of these infections is heavily skewed toward school-aged populations, with children aged 5 to 11 and adolescents aged 12 to 19 exhibiting positivity rates of 73.3% and 67.3%, respectively.2

COVID-19 activity, while present, remains at lower clinical thresholds compared to the influenza surge. Laboratory-confirmed detections for SARS-CoV-2 showed a percent positivity of approximately 3.7% to 5.0% across the province during the same period.2 Despite these lower percentages, the severity remains concentrated among the elderly, with individuals aged 65 and older representing nearly 60% of total cumulative COVID-19 detections for the season.3 RSV activity has shown a slow but steady increase, typical of the late-year period. Percent positivity for RSV was recorded at 2.6% province-wide, though localized levels in children under one year reached 12.1%.2

| Pathogen Metric (Ontario/Halton) | Status (Week 50, 2025\) | Percent Positivity | Dominant Demographic | Trend Comparison |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Influenza A (H3N2) | Very High | 33.8% | 5–19 Years | ↑ Higher |
| SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) | Low | 3.7%–5.0% | 65+ Years | ≈ Similar/↓ Lower |
| Respiratory Syncytial Virus | Low | 2.6% | \<5 Years | ↑ Increasing Slowly |
| Enterovirus/Rhinovirus | Moderate | 10.3% | All Ages | ≈ Similar |

## **Clinical Capacity and Acute Care Occupancy in the Halton Region**

The ability of Burlington’s healthcare system to absorb the clinical demand generated by these infection levels is determined by the operational capacity of Joseph Brant Hospital (JBH) and the surrounding Halton Healthcare network.

### **Operational Capacity at Joseph Brant Hospital**

Joseph Brant Hospital currently maintains 245 inpatient beds.5 During the first half of the 2024–2025 fiscal year, JBH operated at an average occupancy rate of 94.2%. This level exceeds the industry-standard "safe" threshold of 85%, leaving negligible surge capacity for seasonal viral peaks. Clinical analysis suggests that JBH requires an additional 32 beds to achieve a sustainable occupancy level of 85%. The overcrowding not only compromises patient dignity but also increases the risk of nosocomial infections, a critical concern given the "Very High" community prevalence of H3N2 influenza.

### **Regional Interdependencies and Emergency Department Pressure**

The pressure on JBH is part of a broader regional crisis. The Halton Healthcare network, which encompasses hospitals in Oakville, Milton, and Georgetown, reported significant volumes in late December 2025\. Oakville Trafalgar Memorial Hospital managed 91 patients in its Emergency Department (ED) simultaneously, with wait times exceeding six hours.

| Healthcare Facility | ED Total Patients (Dec 2025\) | Patients Waiting to be Seen | ED Wait Time (Physician) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Oakville Trafalgar Memorial | 91 | 38 | 6 Hours, 11 Minutes |
| Georgetown Hospital | 32 | 13 | 4 Hours, 42 Minutes |
| Milton District Hospital | 52 | 30 | 1 Hour, 33 Minutes |

## **Ontario Emergency Department Real-Time Monitoring: Official Data Source Matrix**

Building an "ER Busyness" dataset requires the direct ingestion of data from official hospital dashboards. Ontario's 163 emergency departments report through regional clusters or individual portals. The following table provides a verified list of active ER locations and their official tracking sources.

### **Hospitals Not Publicly Trackable (No Live Clock)**

The following major facilities do not currently provide a live, web-accessible wait clock. For these sites, "busyness" data must be derived from retrospective provincial reporting (monthly/quarterly) or proxy search trend signals:

* **The Ottawa Hospital (Civic and General):** Official policy states wait times are not provided via live public web clocks.  
* **Joseph Brant Hospital (Burlington):** Does not host a consistent live ticker; third-party trackers often show "No Data" for this location.  
* **Humber River Health:** Maintains an internal Command Centre but does not expose a live clock to the public website.  
* **Unity Health Toronto (St. Michael's and St. Joseph's):** Does not maintain a public-facing live wait clock.  
* **Huron Perth Healthcare Alliance (Stratford, Clinton):** No live digital tracking provided.  
* **Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences:** Reports high volumes but lacks a live online tracker.

## **Technical Architecture: Implementing a Snowflake Data Pipeline using Google-Centric APIs**

To complement direct ER dashboard data, you can implement a data pipeline into Snowflake using Google's cloud-based APIs to track community search behavior as a lead indicator.

### **1\. Identifying Relevant Google APIs for Community Health Trends**

* **Google Trends API:** Provides consistently scaled search interest data. It can be used to track regional spikes in queries such as "ER wait times" or "flu symptoms," which act as leading indicators for hospital admissions.  
* **Google Places API (New):** While the official Google Places API does not natively include live occupancy, it provides the metadata (e.g., Hospital Place IDs) required for geolocation mapping.  
* **Google-Centric Scraper APIs (e.g., ScrapingBee):** Since live "busyness" scores are not officially exposed in the core Places API, these services provide a standardized interface to retrieve live foot traffic scores (0-100) for specific coordinates.

### **2\. Configuration of Network Rules and Integrations in Snowflake**

Snowflake's **External Access Integration (EAI)** allows secure communication with both hospital dashboards and Google endpoints.

SQL

\-- Define network rules for Google and Official Hospital Portals  
CREATE OR REPLACE NETWORK RULE ontario\_health\_egress\_rule  
  MODE \= EGRESS  
  TYPE \= HOST\_PORT  
  VALUE\_LIST \= ('trends.googleapis.com', 'hamiltonemergencywaittimes.ca', 'edwt.lh.ca', 'niagarahealth.on.ca');

\-- Create an External Access Integration  
CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION health\_data\_eai  
  ALLOWED\_NETWORK\_RULES \= (ontario\_health\_egress\_rule)  
  ENABLED \= true;

### **3\. Snowpark Python Ingestion Logic**

The core ingestion uses Snowpark Python within a Snowflake Stored Procedure. This logic queries the Hamilton Health Hub JSON endpoint or the Google Trends API.

Python

import snowflake.snowpark as snowpark  
import requests  
import json

def fetch\_hamilton\_er\_busyness(session: snowpark.Session):  
    \# Official Hamilton Health Hub backend URL  
    api\_url \= "https://www.hamiltonemergencywaittimes.ca/api/waittimes"  
      
    \# Execute request through the EAI  
    response \= requests.get(api\_url)  
    data \= response.json()  
      
    \# Ingest into Snowflake Table  
    snow\_df \= session.create\_dataframe(data\['hospitals'\])  
    snow\_df.write.mode("append").save\_as\_table("RAW\_ER\_WAIT\_TIMES")  
      
    return f"Successfully logged {len(data\['hospitals'\])} Hamilton ER metrics."

### **4\. Transformation and Predictive Analysis**

Once data is landed, Snowflake's native **Cortex ML Functions** can be used to forecast future busyness. By combining the **Time Series** data (Live Busyness) with **Exogenous Variables** (Google Trends search interest for "flu"), you can build a robust predictive model.

SQL

\-- Train a forecast model using historical ER logs and search interest  
CREATE SNOWFLAKE.ML.FORECAST er\_occupancy\_model(  
  INPUT\_DATA \=\> TABLE(V\_ER\_DEMAND\_FEATURES),  
  TIMESTAMP\_COLNAME \=\> 'TIMESTAMP',  
  TARGET\_COLNAME \=\> 'LIVE\_BUSYNESS'  
);

\-- Generate a 48-hour prediction  
CALL er\_occupancy\_model\!FORECAST(FORECASTING\_PERIODS \=\> 48);

## **Strategic Conclusions**

The current epidemiological situation in Ontario is characterized by a "Very High" influenza positivity rate (33.8%) and localized hospital occupancy exceeding 94%.2 While major facilities like Joseph Brant Hospital and The Ottawa Hospital currently lack live public tracking, the region can be effectively monitored through proxy data from networks like Hamilton Health Sciences and Niagara Health. By implementing a Snowflake-based pipeline that integrates official hospital JSON feeds and Google Trends search intent, healthcare administrators can move away from reactive crisis management. This architecture provides the foundation for "trigger-based" resource allocation, allowing hospitals to proactively adjust clinical staffing levels up to 72 hours before community transmission spikes manifest as overcrowding in the Emergency Department.
